  I select for this file a user that is not admin
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_beth'
-
  I create a new budget
-
  !record {model: budget.budget, id: budget_january}:
    name: "January Budget"
    start_date: '2013-01-01'
    end_date: '2013-01-31'
    budget_item_id: budget_item_1
-
  I create a first version 
-
  !record {model: budget.version, id: version_january_1}:
    budget_id: budget_january
    name: "Version 1"
    currency_id: base.EUR
-
  And a second one
-
  !record {model: budget.version, id: version_january_2}:
    budget_id: budget_january
    name: "Version 2"
    currency_id: base.EUR
-
  I check that both versions are inactive
-
  !python {model: budget.version}: |
    versions = model.browse(cr, uid, [
      ref('version_january_1'), ref('version_january_2')
    ], context)
    assert versions[0].is_active is False, "Version should be False"
    assert versions[1].is_active is False, "Version should be False"
