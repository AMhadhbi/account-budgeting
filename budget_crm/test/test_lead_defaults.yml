   I select for this file a user that is not admin
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_colette'
-
  I create a lead
-
  !record {model: crm.lead, id: lead_1}:
    name: "Sell something"
-
  I check that the Analytic Account comes from the user's Team
- !assert {model: crm.lead, id: lead_1}:
    - analytic_account_id == ref('account.analytic_commercial_marketing')
