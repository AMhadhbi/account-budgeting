  !python {model: budget.line.invoice.create}: |
    self.do_create(cr, uid, [ref('wizard_1')], {
      'active_ids': [ref('budget_line_1'), ref('budget_line_2')]
    })
-
  I check that the invoice has been created an associated to the first line
-
  !python {model: budget.line}: |
    budget_line = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('budget_line_1'), context)
    assert budget_line.invoice_id, (
      'An invoice should be associated to the budget line')
-
  I check that the invoice has two lines
-
  !python {model: budget.line}: |
    budget_line = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('budget_line_1'), context)
    invoice = budget_line.invoice_id
    assert len(invoice.invoice_line) == 2, 'The invoice should have two lines'
